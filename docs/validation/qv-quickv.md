# Global Validation

## Quickv

If you have a website or application and want to apply the same validation rules to all forms without managing each form individually, you can use global validation.

## Usage

To set up global validation, simply initialize Quickv:

```html
<script>
  const qv = new Quickv();
  qv.init();
</script>
```

This activates global validation for all your forms.

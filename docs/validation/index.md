# Validation
Validation is a crucial aspect of managing forms in web applications. In this documentation, we will explore the concepts related to validation in Trivule and guide you through the different features offered by the library for validating fields and forms.

To make navigation easier, here are the different sections of the documentation on validation:

## Field Validation

In this section, you will learn how to individually validate form fields using Trivule. We will explain how to define validation rules, triggering events, custom error messages, and more.

## Form Validation

This section focuses on form validation in Trivule. You will discover how to configure validation for an entire form using the appropriate Trivule attributes. We will also cover additional features such as automatic validation, customizing CSS classes, and validation events.

## Validation Rules

Validation rules are the conditions that fields must satisfy to be considered valid. In this section, we will review the predefined validation rules available in Trivule, such as minimum length, email format, regex matching, and more. You will learn how to use these rules in your forms.

[Validation Rules](/docs/rules/)

## Validation Attributes

Trivule uses HTML attributes to configure and customize the validation of fields and forms. In this section, we will detail the most commonly used Trivule attributes, explaining their purpose, use cases, and providing examples to illustrate their use.

## Validation Events

Validation events allow you to control when and how field validation should be triggered. In this section, we will explore the validation events supported by Trivule and show you how to use them to customize the validation behavior of your forms.

[Validation Events](/docs/events/)

## Validation Messages

Validation messages are error messages displayed when fields do not satisfy validation rules. In this section, you will discover how to customize validation messages in Trivule using the appropriate attributes. We will also show you how to handle validation messages in different languages.

[Validation Messages](/docs/messages/)

## Global Validation

Trivule also offers global validation features to facilitate the management of validation at the application level. In this section, you will discover how to configure and use Trivule to validate multiple forms or fields simultaneously and how to handle global validation errors.

Validation is a crucial aspect of managing forms in web applications. In this documentation, we will explore the concepts related to validation in Quickv and guide you through the different features offered by the library for validating fields and forms.

To make navigation easier, here are the different sections of the documentation on validation:

## Field Validation

## Validation Rules

Validation rules are the conditions that fields must satisfy to be considered valid. In this section, we will review the predefined validation rules available in Quickv, such as minimum length, email format, regex matching, and more. You will learn how to use these rules in your forms.

## Validation Attributes

Quickv uses HTML attributes to configure and customize the validation of fields and forms. In this section, we will detail the most commonly used Quickv attributes, explaining their purpose, use cases, and providing examples to illustrate their use.

## Validation Messages

Validation messages are error messages displayed when fields do not satisfy validation rules. In this section, you will discover how to customize validation messages in Quickv using the appropriate attributes. We will also show you how to handle validation messages in different languages.

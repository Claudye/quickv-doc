# Validation Rules

In this section of the documentation, we will review the different validation rules available in Trivule for validating fields. Each rule represents a specific condition that the field must satisfy to be considered valid. Here are the available validation rules:

## Strings

The `string` rule allows you to validate fields of type string. It lets you check conditions such as minimum and maximum length, the presence of alphabetic, numeric, or special characters, and more.
